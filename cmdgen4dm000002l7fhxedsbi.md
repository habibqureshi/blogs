## **Essential Cloud Components for Building an MVP**

To build an MVP, you’ll typically need a few essential cloud components. Here’s what they are and why they matter:

* **Frontend:** What users see and interact with — your website, web app, or mobile app.
    
* **Backend:** The system that powers the app, processes logic, and connects everything.
    
* **Database:** Stores important data like user information and content.
    
* **Storage:** Keeps files, images, and documents.
    
* **DNS & Hosting:** Makes your domain and app accessible online.
    
* **Email Services:** Sends notifications like sign-up confirmations or password resets.
    
* **Analytics:** Tracks user behavior and product performance.
    

### ⚙️ **Backend (App Logic & APIs):**

* **AWS Lambda:** 1M requests/month free.
    
* **Google Cloud Functions:** 2M invocations/month free.
    
* **Google Cloud Run:** 2M requests/month free — great for containerized apps.
    
* **Vercel / Netlify Functions:** Free serverless functions for lightweight backend tasks.

* **Firebase Hosting:** Free tier includes 1GB storage and 10GB/month bandwidth — great for mobile apps and lightweight websites.
    

### 📱Mobile App Deployment & Sharing Tools

* **Expo:** Free service to build, deploy, and share React Native mobile apps without needing a full app store submission — perfect for MVP testing.
    
* **Firebase App Distribution:** Free tool to share iOS/Android app builds with testers before publishing to app stores.

* **AWS S3:** 5GB free storage.
    
* **Google Cloud Storage:** 5GB free, 5K uploads & 50K downloads/month.
    

> ⚡ **Note:** Free tiers keep initial costs low but have usage limits. These services can scale easily as your product grows.

### ✉️ **Email Services:**

* **SendGrid:** 100 emails/day free — for transactional emails like signups and password resets.

> ⚡ **Note:** Free tiers help keep initial costs low, but they may have limits. As your product grows, these services can scale seamlessly to support more users and data.

### 💡 **Set Up Billing Alerts to Avoid Surprise Costs**

Cloud costs can quietly build up if something is misconfigured or running longer than needed. Setting up **billing alerts** helps you stay in control and avoid surprise charges.

* **AWS:** Use **AWS Budgets** to set a spending limit. You’ll get an email when you’re approaching it.
    
* **GCP:** Set a budget in **Billing Settings** to receive alerts at 50%, 90%, and 100% of your budget.
