Launching an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is all about speed, focus, and efficiency. The right tech partner can help you ship faster, reduce costs, and avoid unnecessary complexity. Here’s a simple checklist to help you choose the right one.

### 1\. 🚀 Shared Vision

Look for someone who asks about your goals, users, and success metrics — not just “what features you need.”  
A great partner helps you *simplify* your idea to its core, saving time and cost.

---

### 2\. 🧠 Technical Capability

Do they specialize in MVPs and modern tools like React, Flutter, or Node?  
Check past work and ask about their development process — clean code, testing, and documentation are non‑negotiables.

---

### 3\. 🗣 Clear Communication

You need weekly updates, not radio silence.  
They should use tools like Slack, Zoom, and project trackers — and speak your language clearly.  
If communication feels clunky on a call, it’ll only get worse.

---

### 4\. 🤝 Culture & Collaboration

Look for teams that feel like partners, not just vendors.  
They should be flexible, open to feedback, and aligned with your pace and values.

---

### 5\. 💰 Transparency

Make sure costs, timelines, and deliverables are clearly defined from the start.  
Ask how they handle changes — can they adapt when your roadmap shifts?

---

### 6\. 🔄 Long-Term Fit

MVP is just the beginning. Your partner should support scaling, updates, and long-term growth.  
Ask if they document their code, provide handover training, and offer post-launch support.

---

### 💡 Final Tip: Treat Your Tech Partner Like a Co-Founder

They’ll influence the quality, speed, and flexibility of your entire product. Choose someone who’s invested in your success — not just the invoice.
