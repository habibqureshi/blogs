# **What is an MVP?**

An **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** is the simplest version of your product designed to solve your customerâ€™s core problem. It allows you to **quickly test your idea with real users**, gather feedback, and **validate market demand** â€” all before investing heavily in full development.

# **Steps to Create a Successful MVP**

### **1\. Identify the Problem**

* Clearly define the main problem you're trying to solve.
    
* Understand your target audience and their pain points.
    

### **2\. Define Your MVP Scope**

* Focus only on **must-have features** that solve the core problem.
    
* Avoid adding extras that aren't necessary for initial validation.
    

### **3\. Choose the Right Tech Stack**

* Use **reliable, scalable technologies** like **FastAPI**, **NestJS**, or **Next.js**.
    
* Leverage **starter templates and boilerplates** to speed up development and reduce costs.
    

### **4\. Pick the Right Cloud Platform (Leverage Free Tiers to Minimize Costs)**

Choosing the right cloud platform with free services helps keep MVP costs low while making it easy to grow later. Here are my top recommendations

* **AWS (Amazon Web Services):** Free services like hosting, storage, and databases. Great for startups who want a reliable platform that can grow with them.
    
* **GCP (Google Cloud Platform):** $300 free credits plus always-free tools for hosting apps, storing data, and running servers without managing them.
    
* **Azure (Microsoft Cloud):** $200 free credits and free services for hosting websites, apps, and databases â€” good for businesses familiar with Microsoft tools.
    
* **DigitalOcean:** $200 free credits and low-cost servers. Simple to use, perfect for launching MVPs quickly with predictable pricing.
    

## **5\. Launch, Gather Feedback & Measure Usage**

Once your MVP is live:

* **Track key metrics:** Retention, engagement, and feature usage.
    
* **Use analytics tools:**
    
    * ðŸ“ˆ **Google Analytics**
        
    * ðŸŽ¯ **Facebook Pixel**
        
* **Engage users directly:** Ask for feedback and suggestions.
    

This ensures you're building something that genuinely solves your users' problems and helps guide your next development phase.
