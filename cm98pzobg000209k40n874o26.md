If youâ€™re a Node.js developer working on multiple projects, you know how quickly the `node_modules` folder can growâ€”and how much valuable disk space it can consume.

## The Problem

Deleting `node_modules` folders from many different projects can be a pain. It takes time to find them all, and mistakes are easy to make.

## The Solution

To make things easier, I created a small tool called [`nmcleaner`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nmcleaner).

### What it does:

* Scans your selected folder and finds all `node_modules` inside it.
    
* Shows you the list and asks before deleting anything.
    
* Tells you how much space you saved after the cleanup.
    

This tool is really helpful if you have limited disk space and often work on many projects.
